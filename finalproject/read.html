  <h2>I come, as the lightning comes red from above, O'er the race that I loathe, to the battle I love.</h2>
  <p>"These," he whispered through gritted teeth, "are for children." The grandfather grabbed a handful of woodchips and toothpicks off the floor and crumbled the remaining splinters in front of the boy's face before slowly storming down the hallway.</p>
  <p>The boy sat amidst fractured glass and picked up the shard of fabric that once stood as the sail to his model ship. He recalled countless hours under an overhead lamp, and endless concentration as steady fingers and tweezers had helped him become a pirate, hoisting the mast on the wild ocean, allowing him to crash upon uncharted sands on a barren island. He wandered the foreign territory with one eye, and sliced through jungles, but always kept the valiant flags in sight, in case he needed to make a quick escape from angry wildlife, or other sea scurvy.</p>
  <p>The boy's grandfather dozed off in his burgundy armchair, unaffected by the flickers of light and blaring news voices from the television. Scents of dark whiskey and sweat filled the living room as the little boy shuffled to pick up the broken pieces, carrying them silently in the extra fabric of his cotton shirt. He crept carefully past his grandfather, and cringed as he opened the squeaky back door. One last look back at his grandfather confirmed it was safe to continue his journey, and he looked out at the tree line as he quietly guided the door shut.</p>
  <p>Dimly-lit streetlights held his path as the boy wandered to the end of the street. He thought about his old, wooden desk in his bedroom, as well as the sheets on his bed that smelled like mothballs. A rumble of thunder and a flash of lightning threatened the distance, and he quickened his pace to reach the lake at the end of the road. He was running, all legs moving in unison like a ferocious lion, mane flowing in the wind, as little shards of glass spilled from his shirt-pocket. He remembered valuable lessons in history, and knew that sacrifices had to be made, so he left the pieces behind.</p>
  <p>The fence at the entrance of the lake was locked, and the boy shook the chain-link diamonds in frustration. He looked down at the puddles forming in the clay and saw a pool of snakes trying to twist their way to the surface.</p>
  <p>"No, no!"" He yelled, and stomped in the puddle. The snakes disappeared.</p>
  <p>He walked the perimeter of the fence until he found a spot where another eager soul before him had cut to reach the lake. Rolling up his shirt to protect what was left of his ship, he climbed through the hole, and took off running down the hill.</p>
  <p>The air was humid and sticky, and by the time he reached the lake, his bangs were stuck to his forehead. One last look up at the moon, and the boy jumped into the lake. He floated amongst a million-million thousand water droplets and watched tiny moonlit shards of glass float away from his body, out of his shirt, and all around him, reflecting every ounce of light from the stars. His hair floated away from his head, and his cheeks were puffy as the wreckage of wood and tattered fabric sunk to the bottom of the lake, and he rose to the surface, gasping for air.</p>
  <p>His fingertips moved through the surface tension as he treaded water and slowly made his way back to the shoreline. He rolled onto the sand along the shoreline and watched the water float vertically in his peripheral vision. After dozing in and out of sleep, he walked back up the hill and back out through the fence. He found his way back to the street, and when he looked at the puddles this time, there were no snakes-- just calm, shiny, terrestrial pooling water, with tiny shards of glass and toothpicks aimlessly floating with the currents.</p></p>
